You need to know your own stationId, stationApiKey and stationApiSecret

details here:

Davis API: https://weatherlink.github.io/v2-api/

kudos to: https://app.quicktype.io for (almost) avoiding me the hassle of manually parse JSON into swift struct


Conditions:
1) You own the station under your WeatherLink account.
2) Davis Vantage Pro 2  Wireless
